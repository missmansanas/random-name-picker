# How to use
1. Click "Add Name" and enter any value in the prompt input.
2. Each entry will be added to an array of names that are visible in the "Remaining" column.
3. Once satisfied with your list, click "Pick Name." It will take about a second to display a name.
4. After a few seconds, the name will be removed from the Remaining array, and pushed into a "Done" array.
5. Click "Clear List" to remove all entries from both arrays.
